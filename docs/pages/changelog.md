# Change Log

## 0.4.0

### Major version breaking release!
- This release includes numerous bug fixes, api updates, and code base changes make it largely incompatible with previous releases
- To fork development from an older version of `py-feat` you can use [this archival repo](https://github.com/cosanlab/py-feat-archive) instead

### Changes
- Added `animate_face` and `plot_face` functions in `feat.plotting` module
- Revamped pre-trained detector handling in new `feat.pretrained` module
- More tests including testing all detector combinations

#### Breaking Changes
- Columns of interest on `Fex` data classes were previously accessed like class *methods*, i.e. `fex.aus()`. These have now been changed to class *attributes*, i.e. `fex.aus`
- Remove support for `DRML` AU detector
