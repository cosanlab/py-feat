# Included pre-trained models

Below is a list of models implemented in Py-Feat and ready to use. The model names are in the titles followed by the reference publications.

You can specify any of these models for use in the `Detector` class by passing in the name as a string, e.g.

```
from feat import Detector

detector = Detector(au_model='rf', emotion_model='ResMaskNet')
```

```{note}
Models names are case-insensitive: `'resmasknet' == 'ResMaskNet'`
```
